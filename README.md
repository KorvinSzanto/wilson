## DESCRIPTION:

Wilson is a pure ruby x86 assembler. No, really. Worst Idea Evar.

Why "wilson"? I wanted to name it "metal", but there is an existing
project with that name... So I'm naming it after Wilson Bilkovich, who
is about as metal as you can get (and it is easier to spell than
"bilkovich", even tho that sounds more metal).

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Generates x86 machine code directly. No dependencies. No system calls.
* Registers ruby methods with #defasm, or run inline assembly with #asm.
* Terrible, yet, awesome.

## SYNOPSIS:

  class X
    defasm :superfast_meaning_of_life do
      eax.mov 42
      to_ruby eax # ruby fixnums = (n << 1) + 1
    end

    def inline_asm_example
      n = 1000
  
      asm :count_to_n do
        eax.xor eax
        count = self.label
        eax.inc
        eax.cmp n
        jne count
  
        to_ruby eax
      end
    end
  end
  
  p X.new.superfast_meaning_of_life # => 42
  p X.new.inline_asm_example        # => 1000
